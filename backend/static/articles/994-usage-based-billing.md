## Usage-based billing aligns costs with customer value.

**Implementation steps:**
1. Define measurable units
2. Track usage accurately
3. Set up metering infrastructure
4. Handle billing edge cases
5. Provide usage visibility to customers

### Technical considerations:
- Event streaming for real-time tracking
- Idempotency for duplicate events
- Data aggregation strategies
- Billing reconciliation processes

### Best practices:
- Set usage alerts for customers
- Offer spending caps
- Provide detailed usage breakdowns
- Consider prepaid credits

Usage-based billing requires robust infrastructure but can significantly improve customer satisfaction and revenue.
