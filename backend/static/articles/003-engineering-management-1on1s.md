## Effective 1-on-1 meetings are crucial for team success.

**Structure:**
- 30 minutes weekly or 1 hour biweekly
- Employee-driven agenda
- Private, consistent time
- Document action items

### Key topics to cover:
1. Career development and growth
2. Current project progress
3. Team dynamics and concerns
4. Feedback (both directions)
5. Work-life balance

### Common mistakes to avoid:
- Using 1-on-1s only for status updates
- Canceling or rescheduling frequently
- Not taking notes
- Doing all the talking
- Avoiding difficult conversations

### Questions to ask:
- What's energizing you right now?
- What's blocking you?
- How can I better support you?
- What would you like to learn next?

The best 1-on-1s are conversations, not status reports.
