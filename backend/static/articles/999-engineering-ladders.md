## Engineering career ladders provide clarity and growth opportunities.

### Typical ladder structure:

**Junior Engineer (L3)**
- Executes on well-defined tasks
- Learning team processes and codebase
- Receives close mentorship

**Mid-level Engineer (L4)**
- Owns features end-to-end
- Mentors junior engineers
- Makes sound technical decisions
- Reduces ambiguity in requirements

**Senior Engineer (L5)**
- Leads large projects
- Defines technical strategy
- Influences team standards
- Cross-team collaboration

**Staff Engineer (L6)**
- Sets technical direction for multiple teams
- Solves complex, ambiguous problems
- Drives architectural decisions
- Multiplies team effectiveness

**Principal/Distinguished Engineer (L7+)**
- Organization-wide technical leadership
- Industry influence
- Critical project oversight
- Strategic technical vision

### Key dimensions to evaluate:

1. **Technical skill** - Depth and breadth of expertise
2. **Impact** - Scope and significance of contributions
3. **Leadership** - Influence without authority
4. **Communication** - Clarity and effectiveness
5. **Autonomy** - Self-direction and judgment

### Creating your ladder:

**Best practices:**
- Clear expectations at each level
- Examples of behaviors at each level
- Multiple paths (IC and management)

### Using the ladder:

- **Hiring:** Consistent leveling of candidates
- **Performance reviews:** Clear evaluation criteria
- **Promotions:** Objective decision making
- **Development:** Roadmap for growth

**Remember:** Ladders are frameworks, not rigid rules. Adapt to your company culture and needs.
