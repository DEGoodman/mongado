## Revenue recognition for subscriptions follows ASC 606 framework.

### Key principles:

**1. Identify the contract**
- Written agreement with customer
- Commercial substance
- Payment terms defined

**2. Identify performance obligations**
- Distinct goods or services
- Separately identifiable
- Customer can benefit independently

**3. Determine transaction price**
- Fixed fees
- Variable consideration (usage charges)
- Discounts and incentives

**4. Allocate price to obligations**
- Based on standalone selling prices
- Proportional allocation

**5. Recognize revenue when obligations are satisfied**
- Over time for subscriptions
- Point in time for one-time fees

### Common SaaS scenarios:

**Monthly subscriptions:**
- Recognize ratably over subscription period
- Upfront payments = deferred revenue

**Annual contracts with monthly billing:**
- Recognize as service is delivered
- Invoice in advance â‰  revenue recognition

**Usage-based fees:**
- Recognize as usage occurs
- Estimate variable consideration

**Setup fees:**
- Typically recognized ratably over expected customer lifetime
- Unless distinct service provided

### Best practices:
- Use subscription management software
- Automate revenue schedules
- Regular reconciliation
- Work closely with accounting team
