## On-call rotations are essential for 24/7 service reliability.

### Rotation structure:
- **Primary and secondary** responders
- **Week-long** rotations (avoid daily swaps)
- **Handoff meetings** at rotation changes
- **Follow-the-sun** for global teams

### Essential components:

**1. Runbooks and playbooks**
- Clear escalation paths
- Common issue resolution steps
- Links to dashboards and logs

**2. Alert hygiene**
- Every alert must be actionable
- Clear severity levels
- Include context in alert messages

**3. Post-incident reviews**
- Blameless retrospectives
- Action items to prevent recurrence
- Share learnings across teams

### Reducing on-call burden:
- Automate common responses
- Improve monitoring and alerting
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
- Rotate fairly across team members

### Compensation and support:
- On-call pay or time off
- Clear expectations and boundaries
- Mental health resources
- Escalation to management when needed

**Remember:** A sustainable on-call rotation is a sign of system maturity and team health.
