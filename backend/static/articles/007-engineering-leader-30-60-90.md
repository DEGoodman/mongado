## Intro

The first 90 days in a new engineering leadership role set the trajectory for your tenure. Most onboarding advice treats this as a generic checklist, but the fundamental truth is that **context drives everything**. A high-performing team at a stable company requires a radically different approach than a demoralized team recovering from toxic leadership or a fast-moving startup.

This framework provides structure while adapting to your specific context through three phases: Listen, Execute, Establish.

## Core Philosophy

Balance three objectives:
- **Listening over imposing** - Understand before changing
- **Quick wins that build trust** - Demonstrate value without disruption
- **Strategic foundation** - Set up for long-term success

## High-Level Framework

**Days 1-30: Listen, Learn, Map**
- Focus: Understanding the system
- Output: Clear picture of team health, technical state, political landscape
- Success: People give honest answers, not filtered ones

**Days 31-60: Build Relationships & Identify Priorities**
- Focus: Synthesize insights, deliver quick wins
- Output: 1-2 wins delivered, strategic priorities identified
- Success: Team sees evidence you understand and can deliver

**Days 61-90: Execute & Establish Patterns**
- Focus: Demonstrate leadership through action
- Output: Measurable improvements, clear direction
- Success: Team, peers, manager trust you're ramped

## Days 1-30: Listen, Learn, Map

### Week 1: Establish Presence

- One-on-ones with every team member (focus: understand their world)
- Observe existing ceremonies without changing them
- Meet key stakeholders (product, design, adjacent teams, leadership)
- Review recent incidents, retrospectives, team metrics

### Weeks 2-4: Deep Understanding

- Shadow team members doing actual work
- Review codebase, architecture, technical debt
- Understand delivery cadence and bottlenecks
- Map the "hidden curriculum" - unwritten rules, political dynamics, informal power

### Context-Specific Adjustments

**Large, Established Company:**
- More time on organizational politics and cross-team dependencies
- Identify what *shouldn't* change

**Early-Stage Startup:**
- Move faster - may need decisions by day 20
- Focus on revenue/growth blockers
- Be more hands-on technically

**Team with Trust Issues:**
- More frequent, shorter check-ins initially
- Explicitly acknowledge past problems
- Deliver on small commitments religiously
- Extreme transparency about decisions

**High-Performing Team:**
- Job is mostly to *not break things*
- Focus on enablement: "What would make your job easier?"
- Extend listening phase

### Key Questions by Day 30

1. **Team Health:** Actual morale? Flight risks? Motivations?
2. **Technical State:** Debt? Fragility? What's working well?
3. **Delivery:** Where do things get stuck? Actual cycle time?
4. **Culture:** What behaviors are rewarded? Real decision-making process?
5. **Expectations:** What does success look like to manager, stakeholders, team?

## Days 31-60: Build Relationships & Execute

### Universal Actions

- **Synthesize learnings** - Share understanding back: "Here's what I heard. What did I miss?"
- **Collaborate on priorities** - Don't dictate; facilitate with tradeoffs
- **Deliver 1-2 quick wins** - Build credibility through execution
- **Establish operating rhythm** - Meeting cadence, communication style, decision-making approach

### Framework for Quick Wins

Good quick wins are:
- **Uncontroversial** - Team already wanted this
- **Visible** - Clear improvement people can see
- **Achievable** - Deliverable in 2-4 weeks
- **Enabling** - Makes work easier, not different

Examples:
- Fix painful deployment/CI process
- Eliminate useless meeting
- Add missing critical documentation
- Resolve long-standing tech debt everyone complains about
- Improve feedback loop (PR review speed, test speed)

### Context-Specific Focus

**Established Company:**
- Career development conversations
- Build peer relationships
- Quick win: Cross-team friction point

**Startup:**
- Stabilize biggest fire (one only)
- Minimal process to reduce thrash
- Quick win: Visible technical delivery
- Foundation for 2x scale

**Post-Toxic Leader:**
- Demonstrate consistency
- Create positive shared experiences
- Quick win: Fix ignored complaints
- Redefine culture through actions

**High-Performing Team:**
- Remove obstacles
- Focus on growth opportunities
- Quick win: Amplify what's working

## Days 61-90: Execute & Establish

### Universal Actions

- **Deliver quick wins** - Execution builds credibility
- **Set strategic direction** - Propose bigger changes with earned trust
- **Establish team principles** - How we work, quality standards, behaviors to reward
- **Performance conversations** - You have context for meaningful feedback now

### Context-Specific Deliverables

**Established Team:**
- Launch strategic initiative aligned with company OKRs
- Demonstrate cross-team collaboration
- Show manager you understand bigger picture

**Startup:**
- Measurable business impact (revenue, growth, reliability)
- Balance speed with sustainability
- Build processes for 2x scale

**Recovering Team:**
- Visible evidence of improvement
- Team feels hopeful
- Early skeptics coming around

**High-Performing Team:**
- Demonstrable impact multiplication
- Expanded scope/influence
- Effective shielding from distractions

### Success Metrics by Day 90

**Team Health:**
- Real problems discussed, not surface-level
- At least one hard conversation went well
- Proactive communication from team

**Delivery:**
- Shipped meaningful improvement
- Understand good cadence for this context
- Stakeholders see you as reliable

**Relationships:**
- Manager trusts independent operation
- Peers see collaboration, not territoriality
- Team believes you have their back

**Strategy:**
- Clear thesis for next 6-12 months
- Can articulate tradeoffs and priorities
- Ready for bigger changes with buy-in

## Red Flags: Pace Adjustments

### Move Faster When:
- Active crisis impacting customers/revenue
- Team explicitly asking for direction
- Previous leader left vacuum, chaos increasing
- Critical risk spotted that others missed

### Slow Down When:
- Don't understand why something exists
- Team resistant and reason unclear
- Getting surface answers, not real ones
- Quick wins not landing as expected

## The Ultimate Test

By day 90, answer clearly:

1. **"What's working well that I need to protect?"**
2. **"What's the one thing that, if fixed, would unlock the most value?"**
3. **"What does this team need from me specifically?"**

If you can't answer these clearly, you're not done listening.

## Key Insight

The best leaders treat the first 90 days as "earning the right to lead this specific team in this specific context" rather than "establishing authority." Build trust through demonstrated competence, care, and consistency.
