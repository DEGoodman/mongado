- Usage-based billing
- Tiered pricing
- Per-seat pricing
- Freemium models

1. Revenue predictability
2. Customer acquisition cost
3. Lifetime value calculation
4. Churn prevention strategies

### Technical considerations:
- Event streaming for real-time tracking
- Idempotency for duplicate events
- Data aggregation strategies
- Billing reconciliation processes

### Best practices:
- Set usage alerts for customers
- Offer spending caps
- Provide detailed usage breakdowns
- Consider prepaid credits

- Document action items

### Key topics to cover:
1. Career development and growth
2. Current project progress
3. Team dynamics and concerns

5. Work-life balance

### Common mistakes to avoid:
- Using 1-on-1s only for status updates
- Canceling or rescheduling frequently
- Not taking notes
- Doing all the talking
- Avoiding difficult conversations

### Questions to ask:
- What's energizing you right now?
- What's blocking you?
- How can I better support you?
- What would you like to learn next?

### 1. Latency
Time to service a request. Track both successful and failed request latency separately.

**Key considerations:**
- 50th, 95th, 99th percentile tracking
- Distinguish between fast failures and slow successes
- Set SLOs based on user experience

### 2. Traffic
Measure of demand on your system (requests/second, transactions/day, etc.)

**Monitor:**
- Request rate patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Growth trends

### 3. Errors
Rate of failed requests (explicit failures, wrong content, policy violations)

**Track:**
- HTTP 5xx errors
- Application exceptions
- Timeouts and circuit breaker trips

### 4. Saturation
How "full" your service is (CPU, memory, disk, network)

**Watch for:**
- Resource utilization approaching limits
- Queue depths
- Thread pool exhaustion

**Implementation tip:** Start with these four metrics before adding more observability. They cover most failure modes.""",

### Rotation structure:
- **Primary and secondary** responders
- **Week-long** rotations (avoid daily swaps)
- **Handoff meetings** at rotation changes
- **Follow-the-sun** for global teams

### Essential components:

**1. Runbooks and playbooks**
- Clear escalation paths
- Common issue resolution steps
- Links to dashboards and logs

**2. Alert hygiene**
- Every alert must be actionable
- Clear severity levels
- Include context in alert messages

**3. Post-incident reviews**
- Blameless retrospectives
- Action items to prevent recurrence
- Share learnings across teams

### Reducing on-call burden:
- Automate common responses
- Improve monitoring and alerting
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
- Rotate fairly across team members

### Compensation and support:
- On-call pay or time off
- Clear expectations and boundaries
- Mental health resources
- Escalation to management when needed

### Key principles:

**1. Identify the contract**
- Written agreement with customer
- Commercial substance
- Payment terms defined

**2. Identify performance obligations**
- Distinct goods or services
- Separately identifiable
- Customer can benefit independently

**3. Determine transaction price**
- Fixed fees
- Variable consideration (usage charges)
- Discounts and incentives

**4. Allocate price to obligations**
- Based on standalone selling prices
- Proportional allocation

**5. Recognize revenue when obligations are satisfied**
- Over time for subscriptions
- Point in time for one-time fees

### Common SaaS scenarios:

**Monthly subscriptions:**
- Recognize ratably over subscription period
- Upfront payments = deferred revenue

**Annual contracts with monthly billing:**
- Recognize as service is delivered
- Invoice in advance â‰  revenue recognition

**Usage-based fees:**
- Recognize as usage occurs
- Estimate variable consideration

**Setup fees:**
- Typically recognized ratably over expected customer lifetime
- Unless distinct service provided

### Best practices:
- Use subscription management software
- Automate revenue schedules
- Regular reconciliation
- Work closely with accounting team

2. **Impact** - Scope and significance of contributions
3. **Leadership** - Influence without authority
4. **Communication** - Clarity and effectiveness
5. **Autonomy** - Self-direction and judgment

### Creating your ladder:

**Best practices:**
- Clear expectations at each level
- Examples of behaviors at each level
- Multiple paths (IC and management)
- Regular calibration across teams
- Public documentation

**Avoid:**
- Time-based promotions
- Single dimension evaluation
- Vague criteria
- Moving goalposts

### Using the ladder:

- **Hiring:** Consistent leveling of candidates
- **Performance reviews:** Clear evaluation criteria
- **Promotions:** Objective decision making
- **Development:** Roadmap for growth

**Remember:** Ladders are frameworks, not rigid rules. Adapt to your company culture and needs.""",
