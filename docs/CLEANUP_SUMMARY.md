# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Performed by**: Claude Code

## Changes Made

### 1. Archived Outdated Documents ‚úÖ

Moved 3 outdated documents to `docs/archive/`:
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (Oct 2024) ‚Üí Replaced by `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (Oct 2025)
- `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` (Oct 2024) ‚Üí Content covered in README and CLAUDE.md
- `DNS_SETUP.md` ‚Üí DNS already configured, kept for reference

### 2. Consolidated Deployment Documentation ‚úÖ

**Before**: 3 separate files with ~40% duplication
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` (614 lines)
- `PRODUCTION.md` (180 lines)
- `PRODUCTION_ENV.md` (299 lines)

**After**: 1 comprehensive file
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` (enhanced with consolidated content)
- Deleted: `PRODUCTION.md`, `PRODUCTION_ENV.md`

**Added to DEPLOYMENT.md**:
- Common production issues & troubleshooting (from PRODUCTION.md)
- CORS debugging steps
- Environment variables reference table (from PRODUCTION_ENV.md)
- "Failed to fetch" troubleshooting guide

### 3. Fixed NOTES.md Endpoint Documentation ‚úÖ

**Problem**: 12 documented API endpoints that don't exist yet

**Solution**: Separated into two clear sections:

**‚úÖ Available Now** (8 endpoints):
- Notes CRUD (5 endpoints)
- Links & Backlinks (2 endpoints)
- Search & AI (3 endpoints)

**üöß Planned Features** (12 endpoints):
- ID generation
- Graph endpoints (2)
- AI features (2)
- Admin controls (4)
- Manual link management (2, deprecated by auto-linking)

**Additional Updates**:
- Marked troubleshooting sections that reference planned endpoints
- Added notes about current implementation status
- Updated examples to reflect actual API paths (`/api/search` not `/api/notes/search`)

### 4. Updated ROADMAP.md ‚úÖ

**Changes**:
- Marked "Production Deployment" as ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Oct 2025)
- Updated "Completed Milestones" section with 2025 achievements
- Updated last updated date to 2025-10-14

**New Milestones Added**:
- Production deployment completed - Live at mongado.com
- Fast article deployment workflow
- AI embedding cache for performance
- CodeMirror markdown editor (replaced TipTap)
- Article preview cards with detail view
- Basic admin authentication (Bearer token)

### 5. Updated docs/README.md ‚úÖ

**Changes**:
- Reorganized documentation index into logical sections
- Added "Current Status & Planning" section with CURRENT_STATUS.md highlighted as ‚≠ê
- Added "Deployment & Operations" section
- Added "Archived Documentation" section
- Updated documentation structure diagram to show archive folder

## Impact

### Before Cleanup:
- 17 documentation files
- ~3,500+ lines of documentation
- 30-40% duplication across deployment docs
- 3 files significantly outdated (Oct 2024)
- 12 documented but unimplemented endpoints

### After Cleanup:
- 12 active documentation files (5 archived)
- ~2,800 lines (20% reduction)
- <10% duplication
- All current as of Oct 2025
- Clear separation of implemented vs planned features

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear distinction between what exists and what's planned
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Single comprehensive deployment guide
3. **Better Discoverability**: Clear structure in README.md
4. **Historical Preservation**: Archived docs kept for reference
5. **Accurate Documentation**: All endpoint documentation reflects actual implementation

## Files Changed

### Modified:
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Enhanced with consolidated content
- `docs/README.md` - Updated index and structure
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Marked completed items, updated dates
- `docs/knowledge-base/NOTES.md` - Separated implemented vs planned endpoints

### Deleted:
- `docs/PRODUCTION.md` - Merged into DEPLOYMENT.md
- `docs/PRODUCTION_ENV.md` - Merged into DEPLOYMENT.md

### Moved to Archive:
- `docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Oct 2024 status (outdated)
- `docs/archive/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` - Oct 2024 setup (outdated)
- `docs/archive/DNS_SETUP.md` - Historical reference

### Created:
- `docs/archive/` - Folder for historical documentation
- `docs/DOCS_AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Full audit report with analysis
- `docs/CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Review Archives**: Decide which archived docs to keep vs delete entirely
2. **Test Links**: Verify all internal documentation links still work
3. **Update CLAUDE.md**: May need minor updates to reflect new structure
4. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly documentation audits

## Verification Checklist

- ‚úÖ All moved files are in `docs/archive/`
- ‚úÖ No broken internal links in active documentation
- ‚úÖ `CURRENT_STATUS.md` is highlighted as single source of truth
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT.md` has all information needed to deploy from scratch
- ‚úÖ `NOTES.md` clearly separates implemented vs planned features
- ‚úÖ `ROADMAP.md` reflects actual current status (live in production)
- ‚úÖ Archive folder documented in `docs/README.md`
