> **Project Board**: See [#82](https://github.com/DEGoodman/mongado/issues/82)

## üéØ Current Focus

All active development is tracked via GitHub Issues with priority labels. This document provides a high-level view of our roadmap priorities.

---

## üî• High Priority (Do First)

**Foundational UX & Philosophy**

- **#78** - [Improve header and information architecture](https://github.com/DEGoodman/mongado/issues/78)
  - Articles vs Notes distinction unclear
  - Visual hierarchy issues
  - Well-defined spec with mockups
  - **Impact**: Every page view
  
- **#42** - [Review Zettelkasten state](https://github.com/DEGoodman/mongado/issues/42)
  - Align Notes with Zettelkasten philosophy
  - Review existing notes for clarity
  - Inform future UI/UX decisions
  - **Impact**: Core content strategy

**Why these first**: Define the core user experience and content philosophy. Everything else builds on this foundation.

---

## üìã Medium Priority (Do Soon)

**Technical Foundation**

- **#14** - [Testing: Achieve 80%+ Backend Test Coverage](https://github.com/DEGoodman/mongado/issues/14)
  - Prevent regressions as codebase grows
  - Add incrementally as you work on features
  - **Approach**: Test as you go, not all at once

- **#77** - [Progressive/streaming display for AI suggestions](https://github.com/DEGoodman/mongado/issues/77)
  - Improve perceived performance
  - Frontend streaming implementation
  - **Benefit**: Better UX for slow AI operations

---

## üí° Low Priority / Backlog

**AI Feature Polish**
- **#55** - AI Features Manual Testing Plan
- **#34** - Batch article concept extraction
- **#15** - AI: Auto-tagging and Concept Extraction (needs breakdown)

**Infrastructure**
- **#63** - Add resource usage monitoring endpoint
- **#82** - Create GitHub Project board

---

## üí≠ Ideas (Not Yet Scoped)

Features to consider for future development:

- **#13** - Note Templates (Person, Book, Concept, Project)
- **#22** - Export notes as markdown files for version control
- **#35** - AI: Add graph analysis for clusters and orphans
- **#36** - UI: Add knowledge base health dashboard
- **#43** - Zen Mode for distraction-free writing
- **#58** - Search result snippeting with contextual highlighting

---

## üìö Article Ideas (12 ideas)

All article ideas tracked with `kb` + `article-idea` labels. Filter: [article-idea issues](https://github.com/DEGoodman/mongado/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarticle-idea)

Topics include: SaaS billing, engineering management, SRE practices, and technical frameworks.

---

## üé¨ Suggested Action Plan

### Phase 1: Clarity & Philosophy (1-2 weeks)
1. Start with **#42** (Review Zettelkasten) - Quick alignment check
2. Then tackle **#78** (Header/IA improvements) - Clear spec, high impact

### Phase 2: Stability (Ongoing)
3. **#14** (Testing) - Add incrementally as you work

### Phase 3: AI Polish (As needed)
4. **#77, #55, #34** - When AI usage increases

### Phase 4: Later
5. **#63, #15, #82** - When specific needs arise
